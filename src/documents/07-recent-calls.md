# [Number of Recent Calls](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/description/)

You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the `RecentCounter` class:

- `RecentCounter()` Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
- int ping(int t) Adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that has happened in the past `3000` milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range `[t - 3000, t]`.

It is **guaranteed** that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than the previous call.

**Example 1:**

> **Input**  
> ["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]  
> [[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]  
> **Output**  
> [null, 1, 2, 3, 3]

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= t <= 10`<sup>9</sup>
- Each test case will call `ping` with **strictly increasing** values of `t`.
- At most `10`<sup>4</sup> calls will be made to `ping`.
